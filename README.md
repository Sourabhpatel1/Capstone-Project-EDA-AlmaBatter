# Capstone-Project-EDA-AlmaBatter

This notebook is an attempt to start and gain knowledge of Exploratory Data Analysis using python and Pandas on the Telecom Churn Dataset provided by the AlmaBetter Team.

Day 1 : 12/11/2021
  a) The code as of now consists of checking the basic information about the Dataset.
  b) The project requires indepth analysis of dataset to identify the causes of the churn w.r.t. to the Telecom Comapany.
     Initial approach would be to use groupby and aggregation functions to evaluate and find correlation between diffrent featuires of the data.
     Later on Data visualization would be used to effectively communicate the respective findings.
